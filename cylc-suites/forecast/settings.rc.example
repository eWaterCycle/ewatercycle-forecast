# This is the settings file for the ewatercycle suite. This file is include
# in the main suite.rc. Slightly verbose syntax courtesy of Jinja2 processing
# used to include these variables. We use all_lower_case variable names to
# distinguish these from the all caps ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES used in the suite.

## General ##

#Which forecast cycles to run (one per day).
#Will pause automatically for any date in the future.
{% set initial_cycle_point = "2016-08-08" %}

# How many ensemble members to use. Note: 20 is the only really valid value,
# as there are 20 GEFS ensemble members (and "special" ensemble member 0 which
# we do not use). Anything else only to be used for testing.
{% set ensemble_member_count = "20" %}

#Where to get the initial state from at the initial cycle point
#Bootstrap will fail when the previous day output state already exists.
#Bootstrap step can then simply be skipped to continue

## Forcing and Observations ##

#there is no model, and (if needed) scaled to reduce the number of observations
#and thus memory and cpu requirements.
