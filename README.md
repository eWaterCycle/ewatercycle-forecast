# ewatercycle

This is the main code for the eWaterCycle forecasting system.

eWaterCycle is a Global High Resolution Hydrological Forecasting system created in a partnership between [TU-Delft](http://wrm.tudelft.nl/en), [University of Utrecht](http://www.uu.nl/node/499/research/earth-surface-hydrology), and [the Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/).

See [http://forecast.ewatercycle.org](http://forecast.ewatercycle.org) for a live version of the result of this forecast, and INSTALL.md for how to install and run it.

## disclaimer on quality of forecast
This far development of the eWaterCycle system has focussed on proving it is possible to build a complete global operational hydrological forecasting system using open source components. The discharge-output of the model has not been validated against observations and we do not take any responsibillity for its accuracy, nor do we claim that the software provided is in any way free of bugs. Of course, we certainly hope that this disclaimer can be removed in future releases of eWaterCycle.
